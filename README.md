This project was bootstrapped with Create React App tool.

First, run 'npm install or npm i' in the project folder. This command will create a node_modules folder and install the project dependencies.

After the instalation, you can run: 'npm start' and see the app on localhost, in the development mode.

If you want to prepare the files for production, run 'npm run build'.
